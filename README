A learning exercise using Compojure, Ring and Enlive.
Input on more idiomatic ways to use clojure. Improvements in
how compojure, ring, enlive et all are used greatly appreciated.
Also interested in hints on idiomatic namespacing of web application
components.

A basic to do application that just provides for the ability to add new to do items and remove them when done.
No priority etc. There is currently no persistence beyond in memory so all to-dos disappear on each restart.

No tests yet as I haven't read up on the various clojure testing framework options.

Requires leiningen and compass:

Leiningen: https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen
Compass: http://compass-style.org/

To build and run:

compass compile
lein deps
lein compile
lein run -m to-do.server

To use:

build & run then point your browser at http://localhost:8080/
